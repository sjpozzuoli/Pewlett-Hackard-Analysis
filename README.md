# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

### The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help management to prepare for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. The analysis was performed by taking the entire list of employees at Pewlett-Hackard and creating multiple tables to sort them by birth date and department. From these, we are able to visually present the data to management and allow them to create a plan to make sure the departments are prepared in the event that a majority of retirement eligible employees decide to exercise that right at the same time.
