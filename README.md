# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

### The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This will help management to prepare for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. The analysis was performed by taking the entire list of employees at Pewlett-Hackard and creating multiple tables to sort them by birth date and department. From these, we are able to visually present the data to management and allow them to create a plan to make sure the departments are prepared in the event that a majority of retirement eligible employees decide to exercise that right at the same time.

## Results

- The striking part of this analysis shows that there are 300,024 total employees at Pewlett Hackard. Of those 300,024 employees, 90,398 of them are eligible to retire. The retirement population makes up 30% of the total workforce. If all of these employees were to retire at the same time, the company would have to scramble to overcome that much of a loss its workforce. This could have a large negative impact on company performance as a whole.

- As we can see from the below table, many of the employees that are retirement eligible hold senior positions within the company. With a large number of employees that will retire from these positions, Pewlett Hackard needs to make sure they have employees skilled enough to fill these important roles, including naming new managers of 2 departments.

- The mentorship program could be very integral to the overall health of the company. There are 1549 individuals eligible to participate in the program. These employees will help to guide the younger and less experienced members of the firm so they can fill the roles of the retirement eligible employees.

## Summary

- As we stated above, there are over 90,000 employees eligible for retirement. These roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsumani" begins to make an impact. It would be wise of Pewlett Hackard to begin hiring some experienced mid-level staff before a major impact is felt.

- After analyzing the mentorship program data, there are 1549 individuals eligible. Most of these individuals hold senior titles within the firm and would be qualified to mentor the younger generation of employees.
